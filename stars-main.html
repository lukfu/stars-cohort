          It is commonly acknowledged that the prevalence of stress and psychological ill-health is increasing among adolescents. However, knowledge about causes and long-term consequences is fragmented as longitudinal studies in children and adolescents that include BOTH survey of psychological health and physiological examinations are limited. <br>
          Ethnic and demographic pattern in Sweden have changed rapidly and profoundly during recent years, and long-term health consequences need to be researched. Adolescents of today are growing up in contexts of globalization, the increasing demands on education and competence on the Swedish labor market and can readily access worldwide information through the internet and social media. Furthermore, they are living in turbulent times, confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis, and wars and conflicts, hence creating a situation of fear and distrust. There are urgent needs to understand social, psychological and physical circumstances that may cause chronic stress in adolescents, and at the same time, to identify coping and resilient mechanisms. <br>
          Our overall aim is to test the hypothesis that chronic stress, perceived differently in adolescents with different family socioeconomic status and immigrant background, and low resilience to stress during adolescence, predict obesity and elevated blood pressure, and impaired mental health later in life.
